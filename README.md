??? Real-Time Weather Trend PredictorA lightweight Python application that fetches live weather data via API and uses NumPy to perform statistical trend analysis and temperature forecasting.?? Project OverviewThe goal of this project is to demonstrate how to bridge the gap between real-world data acquisition and mathematical modeling. Instead of using complex Machine Learning libraries, this project uses Vectorized NumPy operations to calculate the rate of temperature change (slope) and predict the weather for the upcoming hour.?? Key FeaturesLive Data Fetching: Connects to the Open-Meteo API to get real-time meteorological data.Automated Forecasting: Uses a linear trend model to predict the next hour's temperature.NumPy Optimization: Employs np.diff(), np.mean(), and slicing for high-performance calculations.Clean Formatting: Utilizes Python f-strings with sign flags (e.g., +0.50°C) for clear trend reporting.??? Technical StackLanguage: Python 3.xLibraries: * NumPy: Data manipulation and statistical calculations.Requests: Handling HTTP API calls.?? How the Prediction WorksThe script follows a 3-step mathematical process:Extraction: Pulls the last 3 hours of temperature data into a NumPy array.Difference Calculation: Uses $np.diff(temps)$ to find the change between each hour ($\Delta t$).Linear Projection: Calculates the average change ($\bar{\Delta}$) and adds it to the current temperature ($T_{now}$).$$T_{predicted} = T_{now} + \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Delta t_i$$?? Installation & UsageClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/ayush-130904/weather_prediction.git
cd weather_prediction
Install dependencies:Bashpip install numpy requests
Run the script:Bashpython weather_prediction.py
?? Sample OutputPlaintextRecent Temps (Last 3h): [12.5, 13.2, 14.1]
Average Trend: +0.80°C per hour
---
Current Temperature: 14.1°C
Predicted Temperature (Next Hour): 14.90°C
?? Future ImprovementsAdd Matplotlib integration to visualize the trend line.Incorporate Humidity and Pressure into the prediction logic.Store historical predictions in a local SQL database to track accuracy.
